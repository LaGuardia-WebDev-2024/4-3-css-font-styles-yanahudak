## Directions 
### Step #1 - Make italic quotes <br>
This webpage displays some famous quotes and declarations from movies and TV shows. Add a CSS rule that makes all of the quotes have an italic font style, so they'll look more like quotes.
<br><br>
### Step #2 - Make bold declarations <br>
Add a CSS rule that makes all of the declarations have a bold font weight, so they'll look like they were said in a loud voice.
